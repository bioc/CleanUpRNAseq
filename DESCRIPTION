Description: RNA-seq data generated by some library preparation methods, such
             as rRNA-depletion-based method and the SMART-seq method, might be 
             contaminated by genomic DNA (gDNA), if DNase I disgestion is not
             performed properly during RNA preparation. CleanUpRNAseq is
             developed to check if RNA-seq data is suffered from gDNA 
             contamination. If so, it can perform correction for gDNA
             contamination and reduce false discovery rate of differentially
             expressed genes.
